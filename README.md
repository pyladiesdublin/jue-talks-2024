# Talks
## Talk 1: Building Intelligent Applications with LangChain
(30 mins) In an era where artificial intelligence is not just a buzzword but a pivotal driver of innovation, harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) using Python is more crucial than ever. Join us for a deep dive into the world of LangChain, the groundbreaking library that is democratizing access to LLMs for developers and businesses alike. This presentation offers a concise exploration with practical insights of LangChain. From a quick introduction to a discovery of pivotal features and capabilities that facilitate easy integration of LLMs into your projects and a demonstration of building an AI-powered application with Langchain, showcasing its practicality and efficiency.

## Talk 2: Transformers and the Attention Mechanism - The Core Components of LLMs
(40 mins) In this talk, we will demystify transformers and the attention mechanism ‚Äì the key architectural advances driving the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence by breaking them down into their simplest components in Python.
Designed for a general audience, this presentation will provide a clear understanding of how transformers, the building blocks behind sophisticated AI systems, enable machines to comprehend and generate human-like text. Tony will explore how transformers learn to focus on crucial words and phrases within vast amounts of text data, enhancing their ability to grasp context and meaning.
The discussion will cover the revolutionary impact of transformer technology on natural language processing tasks and its potential to transform various industries. By examining key developments and real-world applications, attendees will gain insights into transformers' transformative capabilities and indispensable role in AI.
